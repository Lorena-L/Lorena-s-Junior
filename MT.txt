Model United Nations

As the debate and Model United Nations own so many members to join, i admitted that i hesitated in the first month of my Grade 10 year. International courses are brand new to me, since there are so many activities I have never tried before. Between a large number of clubs and leagues, the Mock Trial attracted me the most, and that was the time I fascinated in MT.

Compared with other activities, MT requires more flexibility as well as wisdom. It’s just like a combination of debate and MUN, frosting the ability of speech.

 

I was involved in almost every workshop our seniors gave us. There are no coach, no teacher, no tutor to care about what activity you are in, and absolutely, no direct or indirect instructions or training given by our school. All of the knowledge are taught by the seniors, and next year i will teach the Grade 10 students as well. I expect my Grade 11 year so much.

From September till now, I have taken part in the MT competition twice. These experience were so valuable to me that i enjoyed watching my previous videos from time to time. Not only the things I learned from the match helped my a lot, but also the friendship I reinforced with my desk mate(we were the partner every time).

In Mock Trial, you can find many things needed to be concerned. For instance, the way to make an excellent objection, how to be a good council when dealing with all of the questions asked by your co-council, how to be a ‘drama queen’ when acting as a witness. There are so much fun in that, and i will describe them in my series of the Mock Trail journey.
